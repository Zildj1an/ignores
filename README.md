Many GitHub projects don't have the .gitignore file, which bothers me, so I will pull request all of them!

## How to contribute

1. Retrieve lists of users from the GitHub API.
2. Multithread this!
3. Add .gitignore files for other languages. Start with JavaScript, Java and Python (the most popular).
4. I feel like there must be a wise threshold for repository size to maximize number of clone/pull requests. 
5. Make something hacky so that the API doesn't block the IP after many requests (Is it enough to change the IP?).
