Many GitHub projects don't have the .gitignore file, which bothers me, so I will pull request all of them!

## How to contribute

1. Retrieve lists of users from the GitHub API by chunks.
2. Multithread this!
3. Add .gitignore files for other languages.
4. I feel like there must be a wise threshold for repository size to maximize number of clone/pull requests. 
5. Make something hacky so that the API doesn't block the IP after many requests (Is it enough to change the IP?).

### Let's open-source GitHub?

Let's do the exact same thing but with the GPL 3.0 license for every single non-licensed project.
